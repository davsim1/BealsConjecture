# Beals Conjecture
Author: David Simmons
This is a program to find examples or counterexamples to Beal's Conjecture for practice using C and git.
Beal's conjecture states that if A^x + B^y = C^z where where A, B, C, x, y, and z are positive 
integers with x, y, z > 2, then A, B, and C have a common prime factor.  Read more at:

to anyone that publishes a proof or counterexample to this conjecture.  Read more about the prize
at: http://www.ams.org/profession/prizes-awards/ams-supported/beal-prize.  Note that no one has 
found and published a counterexample as of 6/2016 even though many have run programs to find one.
